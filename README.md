# MathMind: LLM-powered Math Helper â€“ Scan & Solve Instantly
## MathMind Document and Introduction
### Project Overview
This project was developed as an undergraduate software design. By combining large language models and image recognition capabilities, it focuses on recognizing complex mathematical problem images in real life. The system can identify text and formulas in the images, convert them into LaTeX code, and then send the code to a large language model for reasoning and solving.

The project consists of server-side source code and client-side source code (Android), which will be gradually made available for learning and reference in the future.
